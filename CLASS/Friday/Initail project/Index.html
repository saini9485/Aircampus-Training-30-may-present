            <p> Laptop computers, also known as notebooks, are portable computers that you can take with you and use in different environments. They include a screen, keyboard, and a trackpad or trackball, which serves as the mouse. Because laptops are meant to be used on the go, they have a battery which allows them to operate without being plugged into a power outlet. Laptops also include a power adapter that allows them to use power from an outlet and recharges the battery.

            <p> Every day, your team benefits from your creativity, hard work, intelligence, and leadership. That is why all of us strive to care and do the job. You do it because you know your team relies on you, and you won't let them down. Your team is there for you, too, even when you drive them crazy.
